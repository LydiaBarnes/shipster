# Shipster

This is a prototype I made recently of what a typical shipping app might look like.  
It supports desktop and mobile.

(Disclaimer: I do not "own" the sample data nor the general concept of an app displaying this type of data with sorting/pagination. However I designed and coded this prototype completely on my own).

## Running

This project was created with `create-react-app` with a few basic dependencies added, so you can run it locally like any React app.
However I developed it in codesandbox.io, you don't need to run it locally. [Go here to view the project in action!](https://m3yzp5lo6y.codesandbox.io/)
